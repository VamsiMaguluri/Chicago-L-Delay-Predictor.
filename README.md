# 🚇 Chicago 'L' Train Delay Predictor

A Machine Learning project focused on predicting delays for the CTA Blue Line using live transit data and historical patterns.

## 📍 Project Overview
Living in Chicago, I wanted to understand if machine learning could predict "L" train delays more accurately than a schedule. This project collects live data from the CTA Train Tracker API and will eventually incorporate Chicago weather data to improve prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- **Live Data Collection**: Custom Python script fetching real-time arrivals from the Damen (Blue Line) station.
- **Automated Logging**: Data is automatically saved and organized into CSV format for training.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Jupyter Notebooks for identifying peak delay times and transit patterns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.14**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Requests, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: PyCharm Professional, GitHub
